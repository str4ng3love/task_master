# TaskMaster

## Description

This is a simple app that allows for adding, assigning and tracking tasks. It is meant as a learning experience, as it is my first phoenix project.

## Features

Users will be able to:

- Create an account
- Create and/or join a group
- Create /assign /track a task
- Flag a task as unassigned / outstanding / completed / delayed / canceled
  ...

## Installation

- Make sure you are running postgresql locally with

  ```
  "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password",
  "POSTGRES_USER=postgres",
  "HostPort": "5433"
  ```

- Clone this repository:

  ```git
  clone https://github.com/str4ng3love/task_master
  ```

- To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
